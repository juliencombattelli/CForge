# This is a template file containing only the main dependencies for this project. Please do not use
# this file directly, prefer to use the versionned requirements.txt file in this repo instead, which
# have all transitive dependencies set:
#   pip3 install -r doc/requirements.txt

# If main dependencies in this file are changed, please regenerate the requirements.txt file:
#   pip3 install pip-tools
#   pip-compile doc/requirements.in
#   pip3 install -r doc/requirements.txt
